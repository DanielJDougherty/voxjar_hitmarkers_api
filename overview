Todo&#39;s left on hitmarker API Project:

- Cron &quot;Code&quot; to our backup folder &quot;Cron Jobs&quot;
- snapshot VM process
- Append missing data from May 6 and 7
- De Dupe May 5
  - Save code for dedupe
- Migrate and rename VM
  - Update documentation if we do that
- Document
  - how to access the backup JSON file on the VM
  - how to manually execute .py scrip to append ia\_summary
- Test process for when we add new search from voxjar build to Py to Gcloud to PowerBI
- Validate we are getting all calls out (GUI shows more results per day than API)

**Voxjar to Google Cloud BigQuery API Process Overview:**

**Note: this is for HIT MARKERS denoting which searches did/did not match calls. This does not pull any transcripts or tags.**

For the Oakstreet Health Voxjar instance, we are using a voxjar created, Dougherty-Martinsen edited, python script, &#39;voxjarapipull.py&#39;.

In this file, row#362 denotes the time frame we are pulling data from. We configure this to be (0,1) pulling a single day of data for yesterday.

We pull with 1-day lag time giving voxjar 24 hours to process audio files into text transcripts.

Which Searches that come from voxjar are denoted in Lines #448 ïƒ 

&quot;search name&quot;,

BEST PRACTICE in VOXJAR for making searches

- When using voxjar GUI/Front end do not use &quot;Exp&quot; searches unless one is specifically working on the API
- Production searches set to last 7 days
- named:
  - &#39;exp7&quot;searchname&quot;&#39; all lowercase
  - Names don&#39;t contain spaces. If it&#39;s absolutely necessary to breakup text one has to, use &quot;\_&quot; for spaces
  - exp denoting excellent search for production
- Do not apply any filters (other than 7days) to exp searches

# **Cron Jobs:**

**Best Practice: snapshot every 90days for BC**
